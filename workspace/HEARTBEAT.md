# HEARTBEAT.md

# Keep this file empty (or with only comments) to skip heartbeat API calls.

# Add tasks below when you want the agent to check something periodically.


## Git hygiene
Check for uncommitted changes: `cd /data/.openclaw && git status --short`
If there are changes, commit and push them.
